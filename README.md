# NBS-Hierarchical
This work is my implementation of a Nash bargaining solution framework, applied to 
network interaction between a hierarchical multi-tier content delivery network.
It uses an exhaustive search routine to solve different scenarios of server interactions.
A benchmark of selfish operation is done using extensive form game.
The next codes entail different cooperation and bargaining situations, each resembling 
real server user interactions.

### Some Sample results: 

Proof of Nash equilibrium for bargaining solution, set analysis:

A comparison between different scenario utilities, which illuminates the incentive to cooperate, 
The utility is translated to server finanical gain in our literature:
